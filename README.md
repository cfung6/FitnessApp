# About FitnessLog
FitnessLog is a mobile app for Android that generates workouts based on the level of experience the user picks. User input (i.e. weight
and number of reps) is stored into a SQLite database. If an exercise is successfully completed, the weight is incremented and
the data is retrieved for the next workout. 

# Features
